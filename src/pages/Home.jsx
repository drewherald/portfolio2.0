                programming. Starting with Java and swiftly moving into the world of web development, it began to consume all of 
                my free time. While I graduated with a economics degree, I knew I wanted to spend my life learning

                skills every day with a hunger to improve. Whether git it be collaborating with a team or building webapps from my 
                home office, I am driven by the desire to create applications that provide value to those that use them
